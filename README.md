Monash-Books-System
===================

Monash Books System (MBSystem) is a web application that incorporates several Java EE technologies. It exposes both a main interface (for guests and patrons) and an administration interface (for administrators to maintain the system). The business logic for both interfaces is provided by enterprise beans. The enterprise beans use the Java Persistence API to create and store the application's data in the database.
